#  Crop Disease Prediction and Recommendation using Machine Learning

This project compares a range of machine learning algorithms for two major agricultural tasks:

- **Crop Recommendation** ‚Äî based on soil and environmental features.
- **Plant Disease Prediction** ‚Äî using deep features extracted from leaf images with ResNet101.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/SwethaAyyappan/Crop-Disease-ML-Comparison.git
cd Crop-Disease-ML-Comparison
```


### 2. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


Preprocessing (ResNet Feature Extraction)
Before training disease classifiers:
```
python code/pre/pre.py

```
This script extracts deep features using ResNet101 and stores them in features.csv.

Training a Classifier
Example (Random Forest):
```
python code/model/code/random_forest.py

```
Each model has its own script inside code/model/code/.
